# transcriptional-bursting
Set of codes for the analysis of smFISH and scRNA-seq data from the paper "Variability of the inducible gene expression is constrained by reciprocal bursting characteristics along gene-specific linear trends"

The repository has two sub-folders:
1.	“Transcriptional model fitting”- includes MATLAB codes to fit telegraph and extended models to the smFISH dataset in the paper. The folder also includes spreadsheets with smFISH count data as well as summary of models fitted in the manuscript.
2.	“Analysis of scRNA-seq data” -includes MATLAB and PYTHON code for processing and analysis of scRNA-seq dataset from Shalek et al. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919153) in terms of mean-variance relationships and bursting characteristics. The folder includes raw and processed data as well as summary of fitted relationships in a spreadsheet format.
